# About me

For the time being, I'm an assistant professor in statistics at the Zicklin School of Business, which is within the City University of New York. Most of the research I've done is on Bayesian hypothesis testing and model selection, but I'm also interested in other topics, such as time-series analysis or foundations of statistical science.
