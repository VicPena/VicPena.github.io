# Bio
I'm a 4th year PhD candidate in [Statistical Science](http://stat.duke.edu) at [Duke](http://duke.edu). I'm doing research on model selection, Bayesian robustness, and foundations of statistical inference under the supervision of [Jim Berger](http://stat.duke.edu/~berger). Before that, I obtained a BSc in Statistics (2011) and an MSc in Statistics and Operations Research (2013), both from [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya](http://upc.edu). I completed my Master's thesis in the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Unit at IRB Barcelona, where I worked on sequential experimental design for RNA-seq studies with [David Rossell](https://sites.google.com/site/rosselldavid/).
