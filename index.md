# Bio
I'm a fourth-year PhD candidate at the [Department of Statistical Science](stat.duke.edu) at [Duke University](duke.edu), where I'm doing research on model selection, Bayesian robustness, and foundations of statistical inference under the supervision of [Jim Berger](stat.duke.edu/~berger). Prior to coming to Duke, I obtained a BSc in Statistics (2011) and a MSc in Statistics and Operations Research (2013) from [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya](upc.edu). I completed my Master's thesis in the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Unit at IRB Barcelona, where I worked on sequential experimental design for RNA-seq studies with [David Rossell](https://sites.google.com/site/rosselldavid/).
