# Bio
I'm a fourth-year PhD student doing research on model selection, Bayesian robustness, and foundations of statistical inference under the supervision of Jim Berger. Prior to coming to Duke, I obtained a BSc in Statistics (2011) and a MSc in Statistics and Operations Research (2013) from Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya. I completed my Master's thesis in the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Unit at IRB Barcelona, where I worked on sequential experimental design for RNA-seq studies with David Rossell.
