## Vectors ##

# Vectors allow us to store multiple elements in a single variable

#--------#
# Basics #
#--------#

# we can define vectors
x1 = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
y1 = c("a","b","c","d","efg")
z1 = c("a", 2, 3, "e")

# exercise: find the class of the vectors above

# ranges of numeric values, ascending and desc.
1:2020
20:10

# finding lengths of vectors with length

#---------------------------------#
# Operations with numeric vectors #
#---------------------------------#
x1 = 1:6
x2 = 7:12

# number-vector operations: +, -, *, /

# componentwise vector-vector operations: +, -, *, /
x1
x2
x1*x2
# find mean, standard deviation, variance, sum and product of a vector



## Exercises ##

# what is the value of 1 * 2 * ..... * 10?

# what happens if you try to find 1 * 2 * .... * 2019?


# Let
x = 1:10
y = 11:20
# find the R equivalent of 
# the function SUMPRODUCT in Excel


#---------------#
# Concatenating #
#---------------#
x1 = 1:6
x2 = 7:12

## append the value 10 to the end of x1

## append the value 10 to the beginning of x1

## concatenate x1 and x2

#----------#
# Indexing #
#----------#

# Idea: accessing particular values of a vector
# useful for creating subsets of vectors

x1 = 1:6

# first entry

# 4th entry 

# last entry 

# third and fifth entry 

# second through fifth entries 

# all but first entry 

# exclude third and fifth entries  

# exclude 2nd through 5th


x = c("a", "b", "c", "e")
# modify fourth entry of x from "e" to "d"
