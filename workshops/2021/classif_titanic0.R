# convert Survived into factor (otherwise caret won't run the algorithms...)


# fit logistic reg with all interactions

# do backward selection with AIC


# fit regularized logistic regression with all interactions


# do the same with logistic reg model w/ predictors selected by bwd selection
# so we can compare vips


# append predictions

# confusion matrices
