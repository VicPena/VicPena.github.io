# Introduction to text mining in `R` workshop

## Basics

**Days:** January 18th, 20th, and 22nd.  

**Teaching times:** 10am to noon, then 2pm to 4pm. We'll meet on Zoom. You'll receive an email with my personal meeting room information.

**My email address:** `victor.pena@baruch.cuny.edu`. 

**Office hours:** By appointment. Send me an email and we'll make it work.

## Prerequisites

* Some working `R` knowledge at the level of [Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r).

* Some working knowledge of linear regression and machine learning methods.

* **Getting access to Datacamp:** You can register for Datacamp [here](https://www.datacamp.com/groups/shared_links/440ca96d99604c790ff2e16d9bbe39e6176674fbe6e3f4a141c62a5b54cdb426). You will have to register with your `@baruch.cuny.edu` email address to join Datacamp. If you want to use another email address, please let me know.

## Logistics

I recommend that you take [Introduction to text analysis in `R`](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-text-analysis-in-r/) on Datacamp. It's a nice and gentle introduction to text analysis which uses packages in the `tidyverse`. After you take that, if you want to learn more text mining with `R`, I strongly recommend that you take a look at the book [Text Mining with `R`](https://www.tidytextmining.com/).
