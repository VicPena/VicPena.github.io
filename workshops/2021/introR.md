# Introduction to `R` workshop

**Days:** January 4th, 6th, and 8th. 

**Teaching times:** 10am to noon, then 2pm to 4pm. We'll meet on Zoom. You'll receive an email with my personal meeting room information.

**My email address:** `victor.pena@baruch.cuny.edu`. 

**Office hours:** By appointment. Send me an email and we'll make it work.

## Pre-requisites

* **Installing `R` and `Rstudio`:** Here are some direct links to download [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/). You should install R first and then Rstudio. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GBZxrQyzM0) I recorded for our undergraduate students explains the process. 

* **Getting access to TopHat:** [Click on this link](https://app.tophat.com/register/student/) to register on TopHat as a student. The join code for the workshop is 742437, the name of the course is "R workshop 2021". 

* **Getting access to Datacamp:** Unfortunately, I'm waiting on Datacamp to activate our course. I'll let you know when they approve it. You will have to register with your `@baruch.cuny.edu` email address to join Datacamp. If you want to use another email address, please let me know.

## Logistics

In our morning sessions (10 to noon) I'll lecture. In the afternoon sessions (from 2pm to 4pm), we'll work through problems assigned on TopHat and other sources. I'll either let you work on your own and be there to answer your questions, or we can go through the problems together. We'll adapt depending on how we feel about class dynamics. I'll also assign Datacamp courses that you can complete at your convenience. 

## Handouts 

We're not going to cover all the material in these handouts, but I thought you might find them useful for reference (or if you want to go further):

1. [Introduction to R](https://vicpena.github.io/sta9750/introR.pdf)
2. [Data wrangling](https://vicpena.github.io/sta9750/wrangle1.pdf)
3. [Data visualization](https://vicpena.github.io/sta9750/plots.html)
4. [Basic confidence intervals and hypothesis tests](https://vicpena.github.io/sta9750/basicinference.pdf)

I'll let you know what sections are relevant to our workshop as we go along.
