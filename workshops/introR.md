# Intro to `R` workshop

## Basics

**Days:** January 21 and January 22, 2020. 

**Teaching times:** 10am to 1pm, then 2pm to 5pm. 

**Room:** 14-235 NVC. 

**My email address:** `victor.pena@baruch.cuny.edu`. 

## Prerequisites

* Read Sections 1.1. through 1.3. of [ModernDive](http://moderndive.com).

* Install `R` and `Rstudio`.

* Get access to Datacamp and TopHat.

Sections 1.1. through 1.3. of [ModernDive](http://moderndive.com) will explain what `R` and `Rstudio` are and they will show you how to install them. 

**Getting access to Datacamp:**  [Click on this link](https://www.datacamp.com/groups/shared_links/927d5587f2230ed904196a426e960624ab38eb26) and use your `@baruch.cuny.edu` email address to join Datacamp. If you want to use another email address, please let me know.

**Getting access to TopHat:** [Click on this link](https://app.tophat.com/register/student/) to register on TopHat as a student. The join code for the workshop is 819361, the name of the course is "R workshop", and the Course Code is is STA2020. 

## Logistics

Your backgrounds are extremely diverse, so teaching a "one-size-fits-all" course wouldn't make sense. Also, after teaching programming for a couple of years now, I've learned that the only way to learn how to code in `R` (or any programming language, for that matter) is *by coding*. 

For these reasons, I'll keep my lecturing input to a bare minimum. I'm going to assign you some courses on [DataCamp](http://www.datacamp.com), give you some extra practice exercises that you can complete on [TopHat](http://www.tophat.com), and I'll give you access to some extra notes I have written for extra support.

My hope is that you work through the content in class while I assist you as needed. I give you recommended "paths" (i.e. sequences of Datacamp courses and exercises) based on your prior background below, but feel free to pick-and-choose. And, of course, feel free to ask me any questions you may have along the way. 

## Recommended paths

If you have no prior coding background, here's my recommended path:

1. Take [Introduction to R on Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r),which covers the most basic `R` functions. Feel free to skip the last section on `lists`.  

2. Take [Introduction to the Tidyverse on Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse), which covers some basics on data manipulation and visualization.

3. Read / skim through my [introduction to `R` notes](https://vicpena.github.io/sta9750/introR.pdf) and do the corresponding [TopHat exercises](https://app.tophat.com/e/819361) along the way (not all of them; just do some until you feel like you understand what was covered in the Datacamp courses).

4. Take the [Modeling with Data in the Tidyverse](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/modeling-with-data-in-the-tidyverse) course on Datacamp, which covers linear regression in `R`. 

If you have some programming background, you can skip step 3 since you probably don't need to reinforce the knowledge you got in step 1. As an alternative, I propose that you either (1) Take a look at my [data wrangling notes](https://vicpena.github.io/sta9750/wrangle1.pdf) in some detail and do the [TopHat exercises](https://app.tophat.com/e/819361) or (2) Take  [Working with Data in the Tidyverse on Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-data-in-the-tidyverse). There's significant overlap between the two options, but they're not the equivalent. My data wrangling notes are more "incomplete", perhaps, but cover more topics (feel free to skip any sections that feel unnecessary). The Datacamp course covers fewer bases but in more depth (additionally, it uses some functions I don't personally use, so it might take me a little while to help you with some of the exercises).
