**Days:** January 3rd, 5th, and 7th. 

**Teaching times:** 10am to noon, then 2pm to 4pm. We'll meet on Zoom. You'll receive an email with my personal meeting room information.

**My email address:** `victor.pena@baruch.cuny.edu`. 

**Office hours:** By appointment. Send me an email and we'll make it work.

## Pre-requisites

* **Installing `R` and `Rstudio`:** Here are some direct links to download [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/). You should install `R` first and then Rstudio. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GBZxrQyzM0) I recorded for our undergraduate students explains the process. 

* **Getting access to TopHat:** 

* **Getting access to Datacamp:**

## Logistics and code

We will have lectures from 10 to noon, and then from 2pm to 4pm. Each day, I'll assign exercises and Datacamp courses that you can complete at your convenience.

Below I'll post the code I write in our lectures:
