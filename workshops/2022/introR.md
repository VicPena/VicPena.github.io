## Pre-requisites

* **Installing `R` and `Rstudio`:** Here are some direct links to download [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/). You should install `R` first and then Rstudio. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GBZxrQyzM0) I recorded for our undergraduate students explains the process. 

* **Getting access to TopHat:** [Click on this link](https://app.tophat.com/register/student/) to register as a student. The join code for the workshop is 680016.
