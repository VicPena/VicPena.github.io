# Intro to Machine Learning in `R` workshop

## Basics

**Days:** January 10th, 12th, and 14th.  

**Teaching times:** 10am to noon, then 2pm to 4pm. We'll meet on Zoom. You'll receive an email with my personal meeting room information.

**My email address:** `victor.pena@baruch.cuny.edu`. 

**Office hours:** By appointment. Send me an email and we'll make it work.

## Prerequisites

* Some working `R` knowledge at the level of [Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r).

* Some working knowledge of linear regression.

* Some additional coding background can be helpful, but it's not essential. 

* **Installing `R` and `Rstudio`:** Here are some direct links to download [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/). You should install `R` first and then Rstudio. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GBZxrQyzM0) I recorded for our undergraduate students explains the process. 

* **Getting access to Datacamp:** You can register for Datacamp [here](https://www.datacamp.com/groups/shared_links/93e614c421fbfdb79b1794c6e571f58a63c48a0b9f7a8e8847e80557f4380fff). You will have to register with your `@baruch.cuny.edu` or `@baruchmail.cuny.edu` email address to join Datacamp. If you want to use another email address, please let me know. 

## Logistics

If you're completely new to machine learning, I suggest that you work through [Machine Learning for Everyone](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-machine-learning-with-r) on Datacamp. It's a qualitative introduction to the topic.

Below, I'll post the code we write in our sessions:

* [Regularized regression](http://VicPena.github.io/workshops/2022/regregression.R)
* [Logistic regression](http://VicPena.github.io/workshops/2022/logistic.R)
* [Confusion matrices](http://VicPena.github.io/workshops/2022/classif_titanic0.R)
* [Multiclass classification](http://VicPena.github.io/workshops/2022/multi_titanic0.R)
* [Unsupervised learning](http://VicPena.github.io/workshops/2022/unsupervised.R)

Here's a [link to some exercises](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IbG2E2OBjh82I5gD_gJrdQyGqrWcTeWf_fLvEvnqikk/edit?usp=sharing).
