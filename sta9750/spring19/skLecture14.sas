PROC PRINT DATA=evals;
RUN;

* scatterplot of numerical variables;

* plot teaching evals by rank;

* are there significant differences between ranks? 
* at the 0.05 signficance level?; 


* is the gender dist'n equal among ranks?; 

* visualize age vs gender;


* predict teaching evals as a function of bty_avg and gender;
* different intercepts, same slopes;

* different slopes and intercepts;

* include age and rank as well;


* glmselect: choose "best model" using backward selection + BIC;


* check residuals of "best model";


* with best model, predict teaching eval
* for 29 yo male tenure-track prof of average attractiveness;
